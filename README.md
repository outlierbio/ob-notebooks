# Computational notebook templates
This repository contains templates for notebooks in Jupyter or R Markdown format, for common bioinformatics analysis workflows.

This is an **open-source repository**, so no project-specific or confidential information should be saved here.

# Repository structure
The `notebooks` folder contains a subfolder for each template. Each of these subfolders contains a Dockerfile with all notebook dependencies installed, one or more computational notebooks, and any supporting code imported into the notebook, such as helper functions.
