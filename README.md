**Work in progress**

# Computational notebook templates
This repository contains templates for notebooks in Jupyter or R Markdown format, for common bioinformatics analysis workflows.

This is an **general purpose repository**, so no project-specific or confidential information should be saved here.

# Repository structure
The folders are broadly divided by data category. Each folder should contain a Dockerfile with all notebook dependencies installed, one or more computational notebooks for specific workflows, and any supporting code imported into the notebook, such as helper functions.
